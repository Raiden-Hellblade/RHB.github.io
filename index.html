                        have
                        noticed. Since I was the one doing them, I was
                        hyper-aware of
                        them, you notice the smallest details when its your own
                        actions,

                    <p>One thing you might or might not not have noticed is how
                        I’m almost always jokingly mean to you—calling you a
                        dumbass, an idiot, or playfully making fun of you. I do
                        this with my other friends too, but never as much as I
                        do with you.</p>

                        I have trouble complimenting you. Over time, I’ve
                        managed to do it here and there, but even now, it’s
                        still rare and usually very minimal. (its cuz you dont
                        deserve any /jk)</p>

                        still think it’s worth mentioning. You might have
                        noticed that I have trouble being honest about my
                        opinions on certain things—mainly when it comes to
                        saying something nice to you or giving you a compliment.
                        You might even remember me jokingly saying,
                        "Argh, it’s so hard to be honest with you xD," but I
                        never really explained why.</p>

                    <p>This one you might not have noticed at all, but I
                        actually try my best not to ask you any
                        questions—especially if they’re about your life,
                        preferences, or anything that might make it seem like I
                        have an extended interest in you or your life. There are
                        more things but they are small details so not gonna

                        Well... the reason behind all of those things is
                        actually quite simple. <br><br>
                        It’s just that—<strong>I’m scared to lose
                            you.</strong><br><br>
                        Really scared, in fact.
                        <br><br>
                        And why am I so scared to lose you?<br>
                        Because... <strong>I love you.</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        Yes—this is a confession..im so sorry...
                        <br><br>
                        I held back on all those things I mentioned earlier, not
                        because I didn’t want to show you how much I care, but
                        because I was afraid that if I did…
                        you’d realize how deeply I admire and love you.<br><br>
                        And maybe that realization would push you away.<br>
                        Or worse… make you leave.

                        I’m so sorry.<br>

                        But it was impossible.<br>
                        Because <b>YOU</b> are… absolutely precious.<br><br>

                        You are the most amazing person I have ever met.<br>
                        You are <b>ADORABLEEEE.</b><br><br>

                        The way you talk, the way you write—<br>
                        Everything about you is just <b>effortlessly

                        <b>You’re the smartest person I know.</b><br>
                        I don’t get easily impressed by people’s intelligence,

                        You’ve impressed me <b>over and over again.</b><br><br>

                        And not just with your intelligence—<br>
                        But with your <b>kindness</b>,<br>
                        Your <b>deep religious knowledge</b>,<br>
                        And the strength of your <b>values</b>.<br><br>

                        I admire you so much,<br>
                        And I’m <b>so, so proud of you.</b><br><br>

                        And that’s still not all.<br><br>

                        Your voice…<br>
                        <b>Omg.</b><br>
                        It’s the most <b>beautiful voice I have ever heard.</b>
                        <i>Mashallah.</i> TvT<br>
                        I literally replay your singing voice messages so
                        often—<br>
                        You have <b>no idea</b> -.-<br><br>

                        And your <b>maturity</b>—<i>Mashallah.</i><br>
                        That’s one of the things I find most <b>charming</b>
                        about you.<br>
                        The way you handle things, the way you think—<br>
                        It’s something truly rare.<br><br>

                        There’s <b>so much more</b> I could say—<br>
                        So many more things I love about you.<br><br>

                        Honestly, I could go on for hours…<br>
                        But if I laid everything out now,<br>
                        And you—uh—<b>rejected</b> me,<br>
                        You’d probably end up being <b>hyper-aware</b> of all
                        the little things I adore about you.<br><br>

                        So…<br>
                        I’ll leave it at that.<br>
                        Maybe you’ll find out the rest later.<br>
                        <b>Maybe.</b> -.-<br><br><br>

                        Everyone has an image of their perfect partner in their
                        mind—<br>
                        And <b>you check every single box</b> on my
                        list.<br><br>

                        I usually avoid getting involved with Pakistani
                        girls<br>
                        Because most of the time, they just don’t match my vibe
                        or humor.<br><br>

                        My sense of humor and values have been heavily
                        influenced by foreign culture,<br>
                        Which makes it hard for them to truly understand or
                        connect with me.<br><br>

                        And the ones who <i>are</i> accustomed to foreign
                        culture<br>
                        Tend to be the type that make you think,<br>
                        <b>“Astagfirullah, the Day of Judgment is
                            near.”</b><br><br>

                        But dating a foreigner isn’t ideal either—<br>
                        Because while they might get the humor and references
                        I’ve picked up,<br>
                        They won’t understand the part of me that’s still
                        Pakistani.<br><br>

                        They won’t get the Pakistani jokes,<br>
                        The little cultural nuances that <b>actually
                            matter</b>—<br>
                        A <b>BIG</b> deal, as I’ve come to realize through

                        <b>YOU</b>—oh my God.<br><br>

                        You don’t just understand both Western and Pakistani
                        humor—<br>
                        You actually have <b>great taste</b> in it.<br><br>

                        And on top of that,<br>
                        You’re <b>religious</b>,<br>
                        With strong <b>values</b> and genuine

                    <h2>Okay... I Might Regret This</h2>

                    <p>
                        Normally, you never show desperation in things like
                        these, because it can be a huge turn-off.
                        But I'm going to let you see this—just so you can
                        understand the depth of my feelings.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        First of all, I know I’m not that desirable... at least
                        not good enough for someone like you.
                        That’s why I stayed away from you—why I didn’t confess
                        before.
                        I believed there was no way I could ever be enough for
                        you.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But over time, I’ve come to realize... <strong>I do have
                            some very valuable things</strong>—things that are
                        incredibly rare in this day and age.
                        And not only that, but <strong>a lot of our preferences
                            actually align really well.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Personality</h3>

                    <p>
                        Look, I’m not one of those gangster-type cool street
                        guys wearing chains and smoking cigarettes,
                        nor am I one of those rough, dominant types.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I’m the type who would hang onto your every word, ready
                        to follow your every whim.
                        My life isn’t particularly exciting, but you know what
                        that means?
                        <strong>My whole world will revolve around you—your
                            happiness, your approval, your validation.</strong>
                        And I’m sure you already know that I really am the type
                        to do that.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I’ve even <strong>promised God</strong>—so many times
                        during prayer—that if He entrusted you to me,
                        just once... if He gave me even one chance to have you
                        as mine...
                        then <strong>I’d crawl across 1,000 miles of broken
                            glass just to keep you happy.</strong>
                        I would do anything for you. I would cherish you.
                        <strong>I would worship you like a goddess.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I’ve been through a lot, and because of that, I have
                        pretty high emotional intelligence.
                        Despite acting childish most of the time online, I’m
                        actually quite mature.
                        That means, with me, you’ll be truly understood and
                        cared for in a grounded, mature way—
                        no childish drama, no toxicity.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I love deeply. It’s life and death, all or nothing.
                        <strong>When I commit, I give my entire soul.</strong>
                        But I’m not reckless with that love. I don’t hand it out
                        easily.
                        Even with my exes, I always took time—testing, waiting,
                        evaluating if they were truly worthy.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And in my entire life, I’ve only met one person I almost
                        gave that love to.
                        Even then, it took six months. But she proved me wrong
                        in the end.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>But you’re different.</strong>
                        With you, <strong>I don’t need to test or wait.</strong>
                        If you say yes... then my heart is already yours—with
                        full devotion and zero hesitation.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Wealth</h3>

                    <p>
                        For me, dating has always been a trial period—a way to
                        learn and grow with each other.
                        That’s why wealth never mattered much in the
                        past—because everything was temporary.
                        It was just... testing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But this is different.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>I’m already giving you all my commitment and
                            devotion from the very start.</strong>
                        You’re the one who decides now—whether I get to keep you
                        or not.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And if <strong>financial stability</strong> is something
                        you need to see a future with me,
                        that’s totally valid. It’s fair. It’s reasonable.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But please... <strong>trust me.</strong>
                        I promise I will work my absolute hardest to achieve a
                        salary of 3.5 to 5 lac per month
                        <strong>before you finish your studies.</strong>
                        And I wouldn’t even be confessing right now if I wasn’t
                        100% sure in my heart that I can—and will—achieve that.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That’s just the minimum I know I can reach within that
                        time frame.
                        It’s <strong>by no means my limit.</strong>
                        You already know I have plans—big ones. The beginning is
                        always the slowest part.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        No matter what, my love... whether I’m earning 50k or 50
                        lac,
                        <strong>I will do everything in my power to fulfill your
                            wishes—even before you speak them.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I’m already working hard every single day, exercising,
                        growing, improving—just to become someone worthy of you.
                        I want to be the best version of myself <strong>for you
                            and our future.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>I will fulfill all your dreams—every single one
                            of them.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Confession</h3>

                    <h4><u>Rules & Boundaries</u></h4>

                    <p>
                        <strong>1. You Are Always Free to Leave.</strong><br>
                        If you ever feel unhappy, if you feel you’re not getting
                        what you deserve,
                        if someone else comes along, or if life circumstances
                        pull you away—you can walk away, anytime.
                        Because <strong>your happiness matters most to
                            me.</strong><br>
                        But for me? I won’t leave unless you hurt me or betray
                        me deeply.
                        Otherwise, <strong>I’m here to stay. No matter
                            what.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>2. Respect Above All.</strong><br>
                        I will always keep things respectful—nothing that
                        crosses your boundaries.
                        <strong>Your dignity, your values, and your comfort come
                            first.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>3. You Come First.</strong><br>
                        Your well-being, your safety, your dreams—they come
                        before mine.
                        Not just out of love—but because it’s <strong>my
                            responsibility.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>4. Honesty, Always.</strong><br>
                        I will never lie to you. Not about feelings, not about
                        anything.
                        All I ask in return is the same honesty from you.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>5. I Will Never Stop Trying For
                            You.</strong><br>
                        Love isn’t just words—it’s effort.
                        I will never stop putting in the work to show you how
                        much you mean to me.
                    </p>

                    <h4><u>Some Things I Want to Emphasize</u></h4>

                    <p>
                        <strong>There’s nothing to lose—but everything to
                            gain.</strong><br>
                        Worst case? We break up. Or I fall short of my financial
                        goal—which is still 1.5 to 2 years away—
                        and you marry someone else like you would’ve anyway.<br>
                        But right now? You’re not with anyone. And I’m here,
                        ready to give you my all.<br>
                        So please, just <strong>give me a chance.</strong><br>
                        Worst case? You walk away. Best case? <strong>You find a
                            kind of love you never knew you needed. ❤️</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Just imagine... what if I actually achieve everything
                        for you?<br>
                        What if you end up liking me back?<br>
                        Then you’re not just getting a man. <strong>You’re
                            getting a husband who would die for
                            you,</strong><br>
                        a man who would make you happy every single day—and
                        never let you feel unloved. Not even for a second.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Oh, and I’ll learn to cook everything you like.<br>
                        I’ll do all the cooking for you... and everything else
                        you tell me to do. Ahem—
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We could even meet in real life and go on some cute
                        little dates. Just the two of us. 🌸
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now I ask you, my queen—<br>
                        <strong>Will you be mine?</strong><br>
                        Please say yes. <strong>Pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
                            TvT</strong><br>
                        Just one chance—I promise I won’t let you down.
