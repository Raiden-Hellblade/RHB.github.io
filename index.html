                        hyper-aware of
                        them, you notice the smallest details when its your own

                        I’m almost always jokingly mean to you—calling you a
                        dumbass, an idiot, or playfully making fun of you. I do
                        this with my other friends too, but never as much as I

                        managed to do it here and there, but even now, it’s
                        still rare and usually very minimal. (its cuz you dont

                        noticed that I have trouble being honest about my
                        opinions on certain things—mainly when it comes to
                        saying something nice to you or giving you a compliment.
                        You might even remember me jokingly saying,
                        "Argh, it’s so hard to be honest with you xD," but I
                        never really explained why.</p>

                        questions—especially if they’re about your life,

                        I denied my emotions, kept my distance, occupied myself

                        Because I was afraid. <br>

                        Afraid that if you noticed, <br>

                    <h2>A Gift From God</h2>

                    <p>
                        Normally, you never show desperation in things like
                        these, because it can be a huge turn-off.
                        But I'm going to let you see this—just so you can
                        understand the depth of my feelings.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        First of all, I know I’m not that desirable... at least
                        not good enough for someone like you.
                        That’s why I stayed away from you—why I didn’t confess
                        before.
                        I believed there was no way I could ever be enough for
                        you.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But over time, I’ve come to realize... <strong>I do have
                            some very valuable things</strong>—things that are
                        incredibly rare in this day and age.
                        And not only that, but <strong>a lot of our preferences
                            actually align really well.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Personality</h3>

                    <p>
                        There are countless traits that, when combined, make
                        someone truly attractive and desirable—and of course,
                        that's always subjective. <br>
                        But you… God damn. I’ve met so many people, been through
                        so much, and everything I’ve learned from those
                        experiences shaped a very specific idea of what the
                        perfect personality is. <br>
                        Not only do you match that description a billion
                        percent, you also fulfill a sentiment I’ve always
                        carried deep inside: that I want to find someone who
                        feels like a version of myself. <br>
                        And truthfully? I’ve never seen more of myself in anyone
                        than I see in you. <br>
                        But somewhere along the line… I started to feel like
                        you’re actually a better version of me—a priceless,
                        precious version that I love dearly and want to protect
                        with everything I have.<br> <br>

                        We both have that rare, adaptive personality type.
                        And as you probably noticed in that screenshot I sent—
                        With most other types, they say “look for the opposite.”
                        But honestly? That’s not always sustainable.
                        It leads to burnout. Misunderstanding. Misalignment.
                        But we?<br><br>
                        I believe our matching personalities would complement
                        each other beautifully.
                        Because we’d both understand the weight, the thought,
                        and the effort behind each other’s actions. That kind of
                        mutual comprehension is rare.
                        And powerful.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In this day and age—where I constantly find myself
                        surrounded by sheer idiocy—you’ve amazed me.
                        Not once, not twice, but repeatedly. <br>
                        There were moments you genuinely left me speechless.<br>
                        Like—“How the hell did she figure that out?” <br>
                        LMAO.<br>
                        It wasn’t just clever—it was surgical. Insightful.<br>
                        Precise.<br>
                        I genuinely love that about you.<br>
                        You're one of the only people I’ve ever actually learned
                        from.<br>
                        You're the smartest person I know.<br><br>

                        I don’t get impressed easily by intelligence—but with
                        you?<br>
                        You've impressed me over and over again.<br><br>

                        And it’s not just the intelligence—<br>
                        It’s your kindness.<br>
                        Your depth of religious knowledge.<br>
                        The strength of your values.<br>
                        Your heart.<br>
                        The way you carry yourself.<br><br>

                        I admire you so much.<br>
                        And I’m so, so proud of you.<br>

                        Your maturity—Mashallah—is one of the most charming
                        things about you.<br>
                        It’s refreshing.<br>
                        It’s admirable.<br>
                        And in a world that often rewards immaturity…<br>
                        It’s incredibly rare.<br>

                        You are the most mature girl I know.<br>
                        And I don’t say that lightly.<br>

                    </p>

                    <h4><u>Some Things I Want to Emphasize</u></h4>

                    <p>
                        <strong>There’s nothing to lose—but everything to
                            gain.</strong><br>
                        Worst case? We break up. Or I fall short of my financial
                        goal—which is still 1.5 to 2 years away—
                        and you marry someone else like you would’ve anyway.<br>
                        But right now? You’re not with anyone. And I’m here,
                        ready to give you my all.<br>
                        So please, just <strong>give me a chance.</strong><br>
                        Worst case? You walk away. Best case? <strong>You find a
                            kind of love you never knew you needed. ❤️</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Just imagine... what if I actually achieve everything
                        for you?<br>
                        What if you end up liking me back?<br>
                        Then you’re not just getting a man. <strong>You’re
                            getting a husband who would die for
                            you,</strong><br>
                        a man who would make you happy every single day—and
                        never let you feel unloved. Not even for a second.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Oh, and I’ll learn to cook everything you like.<br>
                        I’ll do all the cooking for you... and everything else
                        you tell me to do. Ahem—
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We could even meet in real life and go on some cute
                        little dates. Just the two of us. 🌸
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now I ask you, my queen—<br>
                        <strong>Will you be mine?</strong><br>
                        Please say yes. <strong>Pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
                            TvT</strong><br>
                        Just one chance—I promise I won’t let you down.

                    <h2>Okay... I Might Regret This</h2>

                    <p>
                        Normally, you never show desperation in things like
                        these, because it can be a huge turn-off.
                        But I'm going to let you see this—just so you can
                        understand the depth of my feelings.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        First of all, I know I’m not that desirable... at least
                        not good enough for someone like you.
                        That’s why I stayed away from you—why I didn’t confess
                        before.
                        I believed there was no way I could ever be enough for
                        you.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But over time, I’ve come to realize... <strong>I do have
                            some very valuable things</strong>—things that are
                        incredibly rare in this day and age.
                        And not only that, but <strong>a lot of our preferences
                            actually align really well.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Personality</h3>

                    <p>
                        Look, I’m not one of those gangster-type cool street
                        guys wearing chains and smoking cigarettes,
                        nor am I one of those rough, dominant types.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I’m the type who would hang onto your every word, ready
                        to follow your every whim.
                        My life isn’t particularly exciting, but you know what
                        that means?
                        <strong>My whole world will revolve around you—your
                            happiness, your approval, your validation.</strong>
                        And I’m sure you already know that I really am the type
                        to do that.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I’ve even <strong>promised God</strong>—so many times
                        during prayer—that if He entrusted you to me,
                        just once... if He gave me even one chance to have you
                        as mine...
                        then <strong>I’d crawl across 1,000 miles of broken
                            glass just to keep you happy.</strong>
                        I would do anything for you. I would cherish you.
                        <strong>I would worship you like a goddess.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I’ve been through a lot, and because of that, I have
                        pretty high emotional intelligence.
                        Despite acting childish most of the time online, I’m
                        actually quite mature.
                        That means, with me, you’ll be truly understood and
                        cared for in a grounded, mature way—
                        no childish drama, no toxicity.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I love deeply. It’s life and death, all or nothing.
                        <strong>When I commit, I give my entire soul.</strong>
                        But I’m not reckless with that love. I don’t hand it out
                        easily.
                        Even with my exes, I always took time—testing, waiting,
                        evaluating if they were truly worthy.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And in my entire life, I’ve only met one person I almost
                        gave that love to.
                        Even then, it took six months. But she proved me wrong
                        in the end.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>But you’re different.</strong>
                        With you, <strong>I don’t need to test or wait.</strong>
                        If you say yes... then my heart is already yours—with
                        full devotion and zero hesitation.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Wealth</h3>

                    <p>
                        For me, dating has always been a trial period—a way to
                        learn and grow with each other.
                        That’s why wealth never mattered much in the
                        past—because everything was temporary.
                        It was just... testing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But this is different.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>I’m already giving you all my commitment and
                            devotion from the very start.</strong>
                        You’re the one who decides now—whether I get to keep you
                        or not.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And if <strong>financial stability</strong> is something
                        you need to see a future with me,
                        that’s totally valid. It’s fair. It’s reasonable.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But please... <strong>trust me.</strong>
                        I promise I will work my absolute hardest to achieve a
                        salary of 3.5 to 5 lac per month
                        <strong>before you finish your studies.</strong>
                        And I wouldn’t even be confessing right now if I wasn’t
                        100% sure in my heart that I can—and will—achieve that.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That’s just the minimum I know I can reach within that
                        time frame.
                        It’s <strong>by no means my limit.</strong>
                        You already know I have plans—big ones. The beginning is
                        always the slowest part.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        No matter what, my love... whether I’m earning 50k or 50
                        lac,
                        <strong>I will do everything in my power to fulfill your
                            wishes—even before you speak them.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I’m already working hard every single day, exercising,
                        growing, improving—just to become someone worthy of you.
                        I want to be the best version of myself <strong>for you
                            and our future.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>I will fulfill all your dreams—every single one
                            of them.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Confession</h3>

                    <h4><u>Rules & Boundaries</u></h4>

                    <p>
                        <strong>1. You Are Always Free to Leave.</strong><br>
                        If you ever feel unhappy, if you feel you’re not getting
                        what you deserve,
                        if someone else comes along, or if life circumstances
                        pull you away—you can walk away, anytime.
                        Because <strong>your happiness matters most to
                            me.</strong><br>
                        But for me? I won’t leave unless you hurt me or betray
                        me deeply.
                        Otherwise, <strong>I’m here to stay. No matter
                            what.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>2. Respect Above All.</strong><br>
                        I will always keep things respectful—nothing that
                        crosses your boundaries.
                        <strong>Your dignity, your values, and your comfort come
                            first.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>3. You Come First.</strong><br>
                        Your well-being, your safety, your dreams—they come
                        before mine.
                        Not just out of love—but because it’s <strong>my
                            responsibility.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>4. Honesty, Always.</strong><br>
                        I will never lie to you. Not about feelings, not about
                        anything.
                        All I ask in return is the same honesty from you.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>5. I Will Never Stop Trying For
                            You.</strong><br>
                        Love isn’t just words—it’s effort.
                        I will never stop putting in the work to show you how
                        much you mean to me.

                            gain.</strong><br>
                        Worst case? We break up. Or I fall short of my financial
                        goal—which is still 1.5 to 2 years away—

                        But right now? You’re not with anyone. And I’m here,

                        So please, just <strong>give me a chance.</strong><br>
                        Worst case? You walk away. Best case? <strong>You find a

                        never let you feel unloved. Not even for a second.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Oh, and I’ll learn to cook everything you like.<br>
                        I’ll do all the cooking for you... and everything else
                        you tell me to do. Ahem—
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We could even meet in real life and go on some cute
                        little dates. Just the two of us. 🌸
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now I ask you, my queen—<br>
                        <strong>Will you be mine?</strong><br>
                        Please say yes. <strong>Pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
                            TvT</strong><br>
                        Just one chance—I promise I won’t let you down.
                    </p>
